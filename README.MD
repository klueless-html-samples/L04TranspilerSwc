# L04 Transpiler Swc

> Using swc to transpile and polyfill

swc is a new competitor to Babel. It is written in Rust and up to 20 times faster. This can be very important if you find yourself waiting a long time to build your project.

As a Javascript Developer, I want to target the latest ES features while maintaining browser compatibility, so that I can code fast but support older browsers

This code is based off this article [Why you donâ€™t need Babel](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-you-dont-need-babel/)

npm install

# Run the transpiler
